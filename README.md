## Spatial Smoothing
This project was created to familiarize readers with different possible types of spatial smoothing methods. These methods were developed to help reduce the influence of the small number problem in spatial statistics. This problem involves variance in regional populations leading to massive rate estimates and zero rate estimates in regions with small populations.
